The even digits in the applicant’s ID are replaced by the digit one greater then the even digit and the odd digits in the applicant’s ID are replaced by the digit one less than the odd digit. The numeric value thus generated represents the taken number of the applicant.

The first digit in the application ID is ‘2’ i.e., even, it is replaced by one greater digit i.e. 3. The second digit in the application ID is ‘4’ i.e., even, it is replaced by one greater digit i.e. 5. The third digit in the application ID is ‘5’ i.e., odd, it is replaced by one lesser digit i.e. 4 and so on. Hence the output is: 354476
